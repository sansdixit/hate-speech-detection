# hate-speech-detection
We propose an approach to automatically classify tweets on Twitter into two classes: hate speech and non-hate speech. Using the Twitter dataset, we perform experiments by leveraging bag of words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) values to multiple machine learning models. We perform comparative analysis of the models considering both of these approaches. After tuning the model giving the best results, we achieved an accuracy of 89% and a recall of 84% upon applying the Logistic Regression model. We also create a module using flask which serves as a real time application of our model.
